# DL-Project

Baseline implementation:
 - The baseline model is defined and trained in the Project_Baseline.ipynb notebook
 - The three models that are trained can be found in the folder Models. The hyperparameters to get these models are as follows:
   . model_0_96: Beta = 250, z = 10, Epochs = 97, LR = 0.0001
   . model_1_99: Beta = 4, z = 10, Epochs = 100, LR = 0.0001
   . model_2_99: Beta = 10, z = 10, Epochs = 100, LR = 0.0001
 - The visualisations for loss and scene change detection can be found in Visualisation.ipynb
